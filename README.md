This app is a simple reminder app  using npm package sfcookies to utilize browser cookies and store data.

It uses a React framework under the constraints of Redux:

1. There is a necessity for Constants, immutable variables.
2. Actions are within action creators, pure functions that are also immutable.
3. Reducers control and change the state of the store. The store = {} holding the entirety of the application.
